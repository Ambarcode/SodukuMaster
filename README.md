## Sudoku Puzzle Solving Techniques:

There are several ways to solve a Sudoku puzzle, but some of the most common techniques include:

1. Look for singletons: Identify any cells that have only one possible value based on the numbers already present in the same row, column, and 3x3 square. Fill in that value.
2. Look for hidden singles: Identify any rows, columns, or 3x3 squares where only one number is missing. Fill in that number.
3. Look for pairs, triples, and quadruples: Identify any pairs, triples, or quadruples of cells in a row, column, or 3x3 square that can only contain the same set of two, three, or four numbers. Eliminate those numbers as possibilities from other cells in the same row, column, or 3x3 square.
4. Use "what if" scenarios: If you're stuck, try guessing a number and filling it in. Then, see if you can use logic to eliminate possibilities and narrow down the correct answer. If you end up with a contradiction, you know that your guess was incorrect, and you can try another number.

## Sudoku Puzzle Dead-Ends:

Some possible dead-end scenarios include:

1. Contradictions: If you make a mistake and end up with a contradiction, such as two of the same number in the same row or column, you'll need to backtrack and try a different approach.
2. Unsolvability: Some Sudoku puzzles are unsolvable or have multiple solutions. If you've tried all the possible techniques and still can't fill in all the cells, it's possible that the puzzle is unsolvable or has multiple solutions.
3. Stuck: It's possible to get stuck and not be able to make any progress using the above techniques. In this case, you may need to take a break and come back with fresh eyes or try a different technique, such as brute-forcing or using advanced logic.

**Note:** It is guaranteed that the random Sudoku puzzle generated on the website is always solvable.
